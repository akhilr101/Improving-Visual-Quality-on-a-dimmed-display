Improving Image Visual Quality on a Dimmed Display
Akhil Rajavaram

The code is developed primarily in MATLAB (R2022b) and calls a Java class (from within MATLAB). MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox is also used.
Development was done on a Windows 10 device.

Method1_HumanContrastSensitivity contains the code for the human contrast sensitivity-based image enhancement method. 
Method2_IntensitySaturation contains the code for the intensity saturation-based image enhancement method.
Please refer to the README files in the respective folders for how to run the code.

There are sample images generated from each method in the output folder within each method's directory.
